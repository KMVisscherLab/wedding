<h4>Locations</h4>
<p>It will be on Zoom. This is not by choice. We want to see all our lovely friends and relatives and have a big celebration in person. We love all of you so much! But it was not to be. We hope all of you will join us. We are so excited to be getting married and hope to have a in person ceremony very soon!</p>
<p>We will share the link for the celebration on this page as soon as we have it. <h5>It will be a big link at the top of the page. We love links!</h5></p>

<h4>Wedding Registry</h4>
<p>We do not need any gifts. We are both very adult and have many things in our house. Instead of gifts we ask that you donate to either GASP or Girl Scouts of North-Central Alabama</p>
<p>We also understand that some people would prefer that we have a registry.</p>
<p>So we have placed some items on Amazon if you would like to get them.</p>
