								<h3>Wedding Registry</h3>
								<p>We do not need any gifts. We are both very adult and have many things in our house. Instead of gifts we ask that you donate to either <a href="https://gaspgroup.org/support-gasp/give/">GASP</a> or <a href="https://www.girlscoutsnca.org/en/ways-to-support-us/donate-today.html">Girl Scouts of North-Central Alabama</a></p>
								<p>We also understand that some people would prefer that we have a registry.</p>
								<p>So we have placed some items on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/home">Amazon</a> if you would like to get them.</p>
